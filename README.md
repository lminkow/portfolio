## Project Management Work
The Emory Data Science Club (EDSC) has been my strongest contribution to my college community. The bulk of my work thus far came as a VP of Projects. I spent months working with Emory faculty to design data science projects that students could apply to and answer research questions with. Aside from overseeing all the students/faculty and hosting Symposium events with alumni, I work privately with the team leads to ensure they are developing the proper leadership and management skills. Below are the projects I designed:

#American Airlines Baggage Arrivals
Several teams are exploring arrival of passenger bags to a gate as a function of the time until departure, with the goal of testing and fitting the correct distributions. Data provided by American Airlines. Specifics of the project are subject to NDAs.

#Storm Surge Modeling
I worked with Dr. Talea Mayo from Emory's math department, who has experience in coastal engineering research. This team of students is building a dataset using two databases: the National Hurricane Center (to collect storm-level features along the Gulf Coast including magnitude, max wind, size, etc...) and NOAA (to find the corresponding surge height levels). They will then be training forecast models to output expected surge heights across a time-series vector given anticipated storm characteristics. The surge height is what correlates most to the damage done by tropic storms.

#Retrospective Economic Analysis
With Dr. Caroline Fohlin of the Emory financial economics department, I showed this team how to convert old PDF print data into usable tabulated form. They are tracking gold v. non-gold commodities from 1910-2010, with an eye on how the economy reacted to various economic shocks and events of their choosing. This project supports Dr. Fohlin's ongoing research into gold flows. Through time-series analysis and exploration of current events in an economy that now runs on cash, the team is comparing how the economies of different time periods react to news.
