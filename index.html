        <h3>Fitness Calorie Predictor (Jan 2025-Feb 2025)</h3>

        <p> I exported over 840 personal workouts sessions between July 2023 and April 2025 from my Apple Watch to investigate some of my fitness
        patterns. Please see my initial data wrangling <a href="assets/file_uploads/activitydatacleaning.html" target="_blank">here</a>!
        I first explore some of the data to determine
        which variables could be most relevant to predicting my calories burned on a given day. I first test a Ridge Regression model which yields an accuracy
            of 95%. We then evaluate extentively for potential overfitting via residual/feature analysis, mean relative residual, and visualization of variable 
            relationships. Next, we compare with a Random Forest Regressor using nested cross validation with hyperparameter tuning in the inner loop.
            Lastly, I evaluate for potential overfitting through residual and feature analysis
        before answering some other interesting questions. </p>

        <h3>What Does the World Think of GF? (Mar 2025)</h3>
        
        <p> As a patient with Celiac Disease and genuine interests in the food & beverage industry, I performed a sentiment analysis
            over public opinion of Celiac and the gluten free diet. This project is centered around Reddit posts, which were obtained 
            from 6 subreddits, including both general channels and pages dedicated to GF for a diverse dataset. Basic data scraping can be found
            <a href="assets/file_uploads/reddit_scraping.html" target="_blank">here</a>!
        This analysis compares two opular sentiment analysis libraries: VADER and TextBlob. Additionally, I compare the polarity scores of posts 
        from each subreddit and then evaluate how well the assigned scores (positive, negative, neutral) might align with what a human Reddit user would perceive.
        This was a cool way for me to check if my perceived stigma against my food allergy is shared across the wider GF/Celiac community </p>

        <h3>LEGO Set Valuation Analysis (Dec 2024)</h3>

        <p> I am a diehard LEGO fan, and oftentimes an investor/reseller of the product! Out of interest, I cleaned a Kaggle dataset with 2000+
        LEGO sets, including their retail information (price, piece count) as well as their resell prices on Bricklink (major platform for LEGO
        third-party selling). This was a very challenging project due to significant levels of missing data. Additionally, my analysis highlights
        flaws from an industry perspective in how data was collected and why certain results may or may be reliable. Furthermore, I compare growth rates
        in market value of LEGO sets to those of major stock indices and other mainstream investment platforms. My ultimate goal is to send to
        LEGO so they can combine my basic idea with their robust available data to produce valuable insights into the resale market, which may ultimately
        enable the company to narrow their marketing tactics. Please see my data exploration <a href="assets/file_uploads/Lego_Valuations_Project.html" target="_blank">here</a>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Management Experience</h2>
        <p>The Emory Data Science Club (EDSC) has been my strongest contribution to my college community. The bulk of my work thus far came as a VP of Projects. 
          I spent months working with Emory faculty to design data science projects that students could apply to and answer research questions with. 
          Aside from overseeing all the students/faculty and hosting symposium events with alumni, I work privately with the team leads to ensure they are developing the 
          proper leadership and management skills. Below are the projects I designed or oversaw:</p>

        <!-- American Airline Project -->
          <h3>American Airlines Project</h3>
          <p>Several student teams are exploring the arrival rate of passenger bags to a gate as a function of the time until departure, with the goal of testing and fitting the correct distributions. 
          Data provided by American Airlines. Specifics of the project are subject to NDAs.</p>


         <!-- Storm Surge Modeling Project -->
          <h3>Storm Surge Modeling Project</h3>
          <p>I worked with Dr. Talea Mayo from Emory's math department, who has experience in coastal engineering research. This team of students is building a dataset using two databases: 
          the National Hurricane Center (to collect storm-level features along the Gulf Coast including magnitude, max wind, size, etc...) and NOAA (to find the corresponding surge height levels). 
          They will then be training forecast models to output expected surge heights across a time-series vector given anticipated storm characteristics. The surge height is what correlates most 
          to the damage done by tropic storms.</p>


        <!-- Retrospective Economic Analysis Project -->
          <h3>Retrospective Economic Analysis Project</h3>
          <p>With Dr. Caroline Fohlin of the Emory financial economics department, I showed this team how to convert old PDF print data into usable tabulated form. They are tracking gold v. non-gold 
            commodities from 1910-2010, with an eye on how the economy reacted to various economic shocks and events of their choosing. This project supports Dr. Fohlin's ongoing research into gold flows. 
            Through time-series analysis and exploration of current events in an economy that now runs on cash, the team is comparing how the economies of different time periods react to news.</p>
